# WUP<sub>b</sub> - Weighted Urban Proliferation of the settleable part of the study area
Urban sprawl can be measured with and without the inclusion of areas of the study area (feature) that are unsuitable for the construction of buildings. Examples of areas unsuitable for construction include glaciers and perpetual snow, watercourses, lakes and other bodies of water, coastal lagoons, estuaries, inland marshes and peat bogs. Areas where the construction of buildings is not permitted for legal reasons could also be excluded, e.g. nature reservers in Switzerland. Excluding these areas from the calculation of the WUP value leads to a more accurate representation of urban sprawl and to higher WUP values.
