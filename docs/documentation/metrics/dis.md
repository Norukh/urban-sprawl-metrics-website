# DIS - Degree of Urban Dispersion
The metric measures the dispersion of built-up areas based on the distances between any two points that lie within the built-up area. The more scattered the built-up areas are, the greater the DIS value. Therefore, more compactly built-up areas have lower DIS values than more dispersed built-up areas. A DIS value of -1.0 could mean that the built-up area is outside of the study area (feature) or that the SI raster does not contain any built-up areas. The SI raster is a grid that contains for each pixel (built-up area) the averaged sum of the distances (Euclidean distance) to the nearest built-up areas within a radius of 2 km.
