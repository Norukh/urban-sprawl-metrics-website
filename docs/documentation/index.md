This application calculates the Weighted Urban Proliferation (WUP) as defined by Jaeger, Schwick (as described in this [german] [book](https://www.haupt.ch/buecher/natur-garten/zersiedelung-messen-und-begrenzen.html)). Based on the dispersion of the built-up area (the raster input) and the inhabitants and employees for each feature (the vector input as reporting unit). The WUP value is a measure of urban sprawl, with higher values indicating more sprawl.
